Hello everyone, I’m Sundar Raj Sharma, and I’m speaking to you from the heart of Pokhara, Nepal, a place where the serenity of nature inspires creativity and innovation. My journey in the tech world has been one of passion, perseverance, and growth, and I’d love to share it with you.
I began my career as a UX designer, driven by a passion for crafting experiences that are not just visually appealing but truly user-centered. My focus was always on making technology intuitive and accessible, ensuring that every design element served a purpose and enhanced the user experience.
But my curiosity and determination didn’t stop there. I pushed myself to learn more, diving into development, where I began to bridge the gap between design and functionality. This journey wasn’t easy—it required countless hours of learning, experimenting, and refining my skills. But every challenge I faced fueled my desire to keep growing.
As I continued to develop my expertise, I stepped into management roles, where I could bring together my design and development skills to lead projects that made a real impact. It was in these roles that I learned the importance of collaboration, strategic thinking, and leadership. These experiences shaped me into a well-rounded professional who could see a project through from concept to completion.
Through hard work, dedication, and a relentless drive to innovate, I eventually earned the opportunity to become a co-founder at JuniorIT. This was a significant milestone in my career, marking the transition from being a contributor to becoming a leader. At JuniorIT, I’ve had the privilege to work on AI-powered tools that have transformed how students engage with their learning. Seeing the impact of our work, with a 40% increase in student engagement, has been incredibly rewarding.
My work is about more than just technology; it’s about using that technology to empower others. Whether I’m designing an interface, developing a new feature, or managing a project, my goal is always to make a positive difference in the lives of others.
